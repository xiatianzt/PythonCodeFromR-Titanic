# PythonCodeFromR-Titanic

This code is writen with Python, and it's original code is writen with R in https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/titanic/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic/notebook

And this project is for kaggle titanic, I changed the R code to Python code just for practice as a beginner.
If the original owner has a problem with this, I will delete the code.

Every step is the same as the R code, and the comments is writen in Chinese, if somebody needs a English translate, please contact me.
